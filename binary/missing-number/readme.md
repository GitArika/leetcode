# Missing Number ✅
- **📁 Difficulty**  
  🟢 Easy 

## Description

Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`, return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

### Example 1:

> Input: nums = [3,0,1]

> Output: 2

**Explanation:** `n = 3` since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range `[0,3]`. `2` is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in `nums`.

### Example 2:

> Input: nums = [0,1]

> Output: 2

**Explanation:** `n = 2` since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range `[0,2]`. `2` is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in `nums`.

### Example 3:

> Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]

> Output: 8

**Explanation:** `n = 9` since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range `[0,9]`. `8` is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in `nums`.
 

### Constraints:

- n == nums.length
- 1 <= n <= 104
- 0 <= nums[i] <= n
- All the numbers of nums are unique

# Solution
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

```py
class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        
        # Calculate the expected sum of numbers from 0 to n
        expected_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2
        
        # Calculate the actual sum of numbers in nums
        actual_sum = sum(nums)
        
        # The difference will be the missing number
        return expected_sum - actual_sum
```
