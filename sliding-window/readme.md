# 📂 [Sliding Window] Challenges

This folder contains solutions to LeetCode challenges that leverage the **[Sliding Window]** pattern to solve problems involving arrays or strings efficiently. Each problem is documented with a strategy to optimize sub-segment processing without redundant computations.

## 📝 Folder Overview

* **Purpose**: To provide optimized solutions using **[Sliding Window]** techniques (Fixed and Variable).
* **Contents**: Each problem solution is accompanied by:
* **Problem Description**: A brief explanation of the challenge.
* **Solution**: The code implementation using **[Sliding Window]** logic.
* **Complexity Analysis**: Insights into how the window movement impacts time and space.


## 📑 Problem List

| Problem | Difficulty | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Min size subarray sum](./01-min-size-subarray-sum/readme.md) | 🟡 Medium  | O(n) | O(1) |
| [Longest substring without repeating characters](./02-longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/readme.md) | 🟡 Medium  | O(n) | O(1) |

*Note: The list of problems is organized in this README to make it easier to find examples of challenges that use **[Sliding Window]** effectively.*

## 🚀 Key Techniques

Using **[Sliding Window]** algorithms offers advantages like:

* **Redundant Work Elimination**: Instead of re-scanning sub-arrays, we update the result by adding the "new" element and removing the "old" one.
* **Complexity Reduction**: Typically transforms  brute-force approaches into  linear time solutions.
* **Dynamic Adaptation**: Efficiently handles "Longest/Shortest" substring or subarray constraints using expansion and contraction logic.

## 🔄 Regular Updates

This folder will be updated as new **[Sliding Window]**-based problems are solved and added to this collection. Stay tuned for more!
